# Email/SMS Spam Classifier

## OverView
This project is a machine learning model built to classify emails as either spam or not spam (ham). It utilizes the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm to classify emails based on their content and features extracted from them.

## Features
> Uses the Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm, which is well-suited for text classification tasks.
> Employs TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization to convert text data into numerical features.
> Provides a simple and efficient solution for email spam classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of a collection of emails labeled as spam or ham. Each email is represented as a text document with its corresponding label.

## Usage
> Provide the email content as input to the model.
> The model will classify the email as spam or ham based on its content.
> Use the predicted label for further analysis or action.

## Model Evaluation
The model has 
Aaccuracy : 97% 
Precision Score : 1
